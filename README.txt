NAME
    check_apache - Nagios plugin to poll Apache mod_status information

DESCRIPTION
    This script acts as a plugin module for the Nagios IT infrastructure
    monitoring system. It polls an Apache HTTPD server for status
    information through mod_status, parses for the requested value, compares
    that value against warning and critical levels, and responds with a
    status string and appropriate exit status.

    This script handles basic authentication (.htaccess / .htpasswd), SSL
    encryption, and redirection to extract any of the following values:

    *   active_threads

    *   bytes_per_request (measured in bytes)

    *   bytes_per_second (measured in bytes per second)

    *   cpu_load (measured in percent)

    *   cpu_usage_system (measured in percent)

    *   cpu_usage_system_children (measured in percent)

    *   cpu_usage_total (measured in percent)

    *   cpu_usage_user (measured in percent)

    *   cpu_usage_user_children (measured in percent)

    *   idle_threads

    *   parent_server_generation

    *   requests_per_second

    *   server_uptime (does not require thresholds)

    *   server_version (does not require thresholds)

    *   slots_open

    *   slots_total

    *   ssl_average_session_time_remaining (measured in seconds)

    *   ssl_cache_remove_hits (does not require thresholds)

    *   ssl_cache_remove_misses (does not require thresholds)

    *   ssl_cache_retrieve_hits (does not require thresholds)

    *   ssl_cache_retrieve_misses (does not require thresholds)

    *   ssl_cache_type (does not require thresholds)

    *   ssl_cache_usage (measured in percent)

    *   ssl_current_sessions (does not require thresholds)

    *   ssl_expired_sessions (does not require thresholds)

    *   ssl_highest_session_time_remaining (measured in seconds)

    *   ssl_index_usage (measured in percent)

    *   ssl_indexes_per_subcache (does not require thresholds)

    *   ssl_lowest_session_time_remaining (measured in seconds)

    *   ssl_shared_memory (measured in bytes, does not require thresholds)

    *   ssl_subcaches (does not require thresholds)

    *   ssl_total_sessions (does not require thresholds)

    *   ssl_uncached_unexpired_sessions (does not require thresholds)

    *   threads_closing_connection

    *   threads_dns_lookup

    *   threads_gracefully_finishing

    *   threads_idly_cleaning

    *   threads_keepalive

    *   threads_logging

    *   threads_reading_request

    *   threads_sending_reply

    *   threads_starting_up

    *   threads_waiting_for_connection

    *   total_accesses (does not require thresholds)

    *   total_traffic (measured in bytes, does not require thresholds)

        Note: mod_status calculates requests_per_second and bytes_per_second
        as an average of requests and bytes over uptime. These do not
        represent a rolling average.

        Note: mod_status calculates the following SSL-related values as of
        the most recent server restart: ssl_total_sessions,
        ssl_expired_sessions, ssl_uncached_unexpired_sessions,
        ssl_cache_retrieve_hits, ssl_cache_retrieve_misses,
        ssl_cache_remove_hits, ssl_cache_remove_misses.

    This has been tested with Apache/2.2.10 (Unix) and should work with any
    HTTPD 2.x running mod_status. Most Apache HTTPD builds come with
    mod_status pre- compiled: you usually don't have to load it manually.
    One way to configure mod_status on an HTTPD server is to include the
    following in your httpd.conf:

            ExtendedStatus On
            <Location /server-status>
                    SetHandler server-status
                    Order deny,allow
                    Deny from all
                    Allow from 127.0.0.1
                    Allow from 192.168.1.10
            </Location>

    You will ideally want to encrypt this through SSL, protect it behind an
    .htaccess file, or both. At very minimum, it would be good practice to
    white- list any IPs which will need access to status information with
    'Allow from' directives rather than Allowing from all and relying on a
    blacklist.

SYNOPSIS
  Command Line Interface
    Poll status on a server with no encryption or authentication:

            check_apache -H your_host.com -w 160 -c 200 \
            -m active_threads

    Poll status on a server with encryption but no authentication:

            check_apache -S -P 443 -H your_host.com -w 160 \
            -c 200 -m active_threads

    Poll status on a server with encryption and authentication:

            check_apache -S -P 443 -H your_host.com -w 160 \
            -c 200 -m active_threads -u username -p password

    Poll a server with command line options stored in a configuration file:

            check_apache --extra-opts=my_config.ini

  Running within Nagios
    In objects/commands.cfg:

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION
    Q: I've checked all of my command line arguments thrice, but am still
    getting "APACHE UNKNOWN - Host returned HTTP code 500." on an otherwise
    working server. I've even run it with -v and verified that the URI it
    generates if correct: I can copy and paste it into Firefox and
    everything and it works there! What gives?

    A: If you've using SSL, you need to install Crypt::SSLeay. Also, if
    you're not polling port 80, don't forget to specify your port with the
    -P option.

SEE ALSO
    If using an external configuration file, it should be structured
    according to the specification at
    <http://nagiosplugins.org/extra-opts/>.

    If you intend on processing requests over SSL, you will need the
    Crypt::SSLeay module installed.
